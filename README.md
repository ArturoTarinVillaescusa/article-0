  "Weâ€™ve hosted a Neo4j database for you with the dataset already loaded. When you run ./train.py it will use our hosted database by default.

  If you want to host the data locally, install Neo4j, and use our generate-data repository to generate dataset article-0 then update settings.json to point at your database.

  You can inspect the data for yourself. Open the Neo4j browser with this username and password , then try the query MATCH g = (person) -[:WROTE]-> (review) -[:OF]-> (product) RETURN g LIMIT 100"
